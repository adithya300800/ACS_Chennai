# ACS Chennai / VirtualOffice React Website

This is a modern React (Vite) site for ACS Chennai / VirtualOffice, featuring a technical company profile, projects, team, careers, blog, and a contact form.

## Local Development

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```

## Production Build

## Deploy

- Deploy the `dist/` folder to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc).
- For GitHub Pages, the app uses `HashRouter` and `vite.config.js` sets `base: "/ACS_Chennai/"`. Adjust base if your repo name differs.
- You can publish via `git subtree` or tools like `gh-pages`.

## Contact Form

  - `VITE_HERO_VIDEO_URL=https://.../construction.mp4`
